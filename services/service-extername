Services with type ExternalName work as other regular services, but when you want to access to that service name,
instead of returning cluster-ip of this service, it returns CNAME record with value that mentioned in
externalName: parameter of service.

As example mentioned in Kubernetes Documentation:

kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: dbserver.example.com
  ports:
  - name: pg
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80

kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 --rm utils -it --image dubareddy/utils bash

When you want to do curl -v http://my-service or curl -v http://my-service.default.svc.cluster.local
according your namespace(in this example it is default), it will redirect you at the DNS level to http://my.database.example.com
